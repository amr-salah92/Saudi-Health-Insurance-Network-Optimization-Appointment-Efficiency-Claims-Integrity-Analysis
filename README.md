## **Project Name**

**Saudi National Health Insurance ‚Äì Healthcare Appointment & Claims Efficiency Analysis**

---

## **Project Background**

Saudi National Health Insurance (SNHI) is a key government-backed insurer serving over 5 million citizens and residents since 2018. SNHI partners with thousands of clinics, hospitals, and specialized providers across major Saudi cities such as Riyadh, Jeddah, Khobar, and Dammam.

SNHI manages an integrated digital health claims and appointment booking ecosystem. Over 50,000 appointment records and 250,000+ healthcare claim records are processed annually. The analysis below was conducted to identify operational bottlenecks, minimize financial inefficiencies, and optimize patient flow across its network.

---

## **Project Goals**

As the lead data analyst, my goals were to:

* Quantify and reduce no-shows, cancellations, and long wait times that degrade appointment performance.
* Identify high-risk providers with mismatched specialties or inefficient scheduling practices.
* Detect claims leakage caused by denial errors, improper overpayments, and pre-authorization gaps.
* Benchmark performance by city, provider, and insurance tier to implement targeted efficiency strategies.

---

## **Insights and Recommendations**

### **Category 1: Appointment Outcomes & Wait Times**

#### Key Insights:

* Completed appointments: 32,481 (65%)
* No-shows: 5,034 (10%), **strongly correlated with wait times** (avg 67.99 mins)
* Follow-ups & consultations had the **highest no-show and cancellation wait times**
* Emergency visits had **lowest wait times and highest completion efficiency**

#### Recommendations:

* Implement SMS reminders + proactive rescheduling for appointments exceeding 67 minutes.
* Introduce 15-min buffer slots for follow-ups and consultations.
* Replicate emergency department triage speed in other appointment types.

---

### **Category 2: Provider Efficiency & Operational Risk**

#### Key Insights:

* 23,938 unique providers, **65% handled only one appointment**
* Over 1,100 providers averaged the **maximum 120-min wait**
* Provider PRV007848 had a 75% cancellation rate, **handling complex surgeries inappropriately at imaging centers**

#### Recommendations:

* Reassign providers with 15-min avg wait to consultation-heavy departments.
* Suspend providers with >50% cancellation rate pending retraining.
* Consolidate appointments from 15,000+ single-appointment providers to improve patient continuity.

---

### **Category 3: Claims Denials & Financial Exposure**

#### Key Insights:

* **SAR 75.3M paid in error**; **SAR 55.9M paid on claims without denial codes**
* Top denial reasons:

  * Pre-existing conditions: 41.8%
  * Non-covered services: 29.6%
  * Insufficient documentation: 18.9%
* Submission delays range 0‚Äì29 days, disrupting financial forecasting

#### Recommendations:

* Launch 90-day overpayment recovery & voluntary repayment initiative.
* Enforce mandatory denial reason codes before approval.
* Penalize claim submissions >7 days post-visit with 5% reimbursement cut.

---

### **Category 4: Insurance Plan & Regional Performance**

#### Key Insights:

* **Bupa Premium** had the **highest wait times (68.7 mins)** despite being top-tier
* **Dammam** showed the **worst surgical wait times (67.8 mins)**
* **Khobar** had high overall waits despite mid-volume patient load
* **SA Cares** consistently delivered highest coverage efficiency

#### Recommendations:

* Guarantee ‚â§60-min wait for Bupa Premium via contract renegotiation
* Expand Taif‚Äôs low-wait surgeon scheduling model to Dammam
* Launch \$25 credit reactivation program targeting 7,507 inactive patients

---

## **Data Collection and Sources**

Data was extracted from the SNHI relational claims and appointment databases. No APIs were used. Manual CSV ingestion was performed for supplementary patient info (insurance tier, city, specialty) and claim denial mappings.

---

## **Formal Data Governance**

* Column standardization for provider IDs, date formatting (ISO 8601), and appointment outcomes
* Null value handling: rescheduling dates and wait times cleaned and verified against actual timestamps
* Proposed governance: implement denial reason validation logic + timestamp auto-auditing

---

## **Regulatory Reporting**

Compliance issues were flagged, especially in overpaid claims with no denial code (SAR 55.9M). System redesign is recommended to enforce documentation compliance and reduce legal exposure. A regulator-aligned denial taxonomy should be implemented.

---

## **Methodology**

* SQL used for data cleaning, joining, transformation
* Statistical analysis (mean, correlation r-values, variance decomposition) for wait time and claims
* Tableau dashboards built for city/provider/insurance segmentation
* Conditional logic for risk flagging (e.g., cancellation % > 50, wait time > 90 mins)

| `description`                                                              | Human-readable description of the procedure code (e.g., "MRI scan of brain").                     | Improves interpretability in reports and dashboards; supports categorization for clinical and financial analysis.     |
| `allowed_amount`                                                           | Maximum amount the insurer has agreed to pay for the procedure based on contract or policy terms. | Useful for analyzing cost containment, comparing billed vs. allowed vs. paid, and detecting pricing outliers.         |

## **Executive Summary**

**(Stakeholder: Claims & Operations Director)**
Appointment bottlenecks and claim overpayments are costing SNHI millions. The biggest risks come from surgeries with long waits, providers handling mismatched cases (e.g. emergencies in imaging centers), and poorly governed claim denial systems.

> Three takeaways:
>
> * Reducing wait time by just **1 minute** may eliminate **250 no-shows**.
> * Over **SAR 75M in claim payments were made erroneously** or without justification.
> * Top-tier insurance patients receive **worse service** than economy-tier‚Äîindicating broken prioritization.

## **Insights Deep Dive**

### **Category 1: Appointment Outcomes & Wait Times**

* **10% of appointments end in no-shows**, with avg wait time of 67.99 mins
* **Follow-up appointments**: highest no-show wait time (68.83 mins)
* **Reschedules occur earliest** (66.92 mins), showing patients reschedule proactively if wait is long
* Emergency care had shortest wait (66.97 mins), validating triage effectiveness

---

### **Category 2: Provider Efficiency & Operational Risk**

* 65.5% of providers had only **1 completed appointment**
* **PRV007848** had a 75% cancellation rate, violating specialty scope
* Over 1,100 providers had **120-min avg waits**, driving up system-wide attrition
* Best-performing providers (15-min avg wait) were underutilized

---

### **Category 3: Claims Denials & Financial Exposure**

* SAR 75.3M paid erroneously; 98.5% coverage rate shows **excessive leniency**
* 41.8% of denials due to **pre-existing conditions** = weak eligibility checks
* No-denial-reason claims still got **SAR 55.9M paid**
* Submission delays range up to 29 days = poor cash flow management

---

### **Category 4: Insurance Plan & Regional Performance**

* **Dammam** had worst surgical wait (67.8 mins); **Taif** had best (66.4 mins)
* **Bupa Premium patients** received worse service than SA Cares
* **Internal Medicine** had highest wait times (68.0 mins) despite being core specialty
* **Khobar** had worst overall performance vs. mid-level patient volume

---

## **Recommendations**

For the **Claims, Operations, and Network Management Teams**:

* Redirect surgeries to compliant facilities with <66-min avg wait
* Freeze payouts to providers with unexplained overpayments > SAR 100,000
* Reassign underutilized efficient providers to high-wait appointment types
* Enforce contractual penalties for >90-min provider wait times
* Offer fast-track lanes for Bupa Premium members to match expectations

---

## **Future Work**

* Incorporate patient feedback surveys to understand non-wait-related cancellations
* Develop predictive models for no-show likelihood using wait, type, insurance, and provider history
* Launch monthly claim denial audit dashboards with NLP on clinical notes

---

## **Technical Details**

**Tools Used:**

* **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy)**: For statistical analysis and advanced filtering
* **Tableau**: For building dynamic dashboards and wait time visualizations

* SQL queries for data cleaning: \[link]

---

## **Assumptions and Caveats**

* **Assumption 1**: No-show appointments without a completion timestamp were considered canceled if rescheduled within 3 days
* **Assumption 2**: Missing wait times were imputed using the average wait by appointment type
* **Assumption 3**: Claims where `amount_paid > amount_claimed` were treated as overpayments unless tagged "bonus" or "penalty adjustment"
