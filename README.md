## **Project Name**
**Saudi Health Insurance Network Optimization: Appointment Efficiency & Claims Integrity Analysis**

---

## **Project Background**
Saudi National Health Insurance (SNHI) is a key government-backed insurer serving over 5 million citizens and residents since 2018. SNHI partners with thousands of clinics, hospitals, and specialized providers across major Saudi cities such as Riyadh, Jeddah, Khobar, and Dammam.

SNHI manages an integrated digital health claims and appointment booking ecosystem. Over 50,000 appointment records and 250,000+ healthcare claim records are processed annually. The analysis below was conducted to identify operational bottlenecks, minimize financial inefficiencies, and optimize patient flow across its network.

---

## **Project Goals**
As the lead data analyst, my goals were to:
* Quantify and reduce no-shows, cancellations, and long wait times that degrade appointment performance
* Identify high-risk providers with mismatched specialties or inefficient scheduling practices
* Detect claims leakage caused by denial errors, improper overpayments, and pre-authorization gaps
* Benchmark performance by city, provider, and insurance tier to implement targeted efficiency strategies

---

## **Insights**

### **Category 1: Appointment Outcomes & Wait Times**
#### Key Insights:
* Completed appointments: 32,481 (65%)
* No-shows: 5,034 (10%), **strongly correlated with wait times** (avg 67.99 mins)
* Follow-ups & consultations had the **highest no-show and cancellation wait times**
* Emergency visits had **lowest wait times and highest completion efficiency**

---

### **Category 2: Provider Efficiency & Operational Risk**
#### Key Insights:
* 23,938 unique providers, **65% handled only one appointment**
* Over 1,100 providers averaged the **maximum 120-min wait**
* Provider PRV007848 had a 75% cancellation rate, **handling complex surgeries inappropriately at imaging centers**

---

### **Category 3: Claims Denials & Financial Exposure**
#### Key Insights:
- **SAR 75.85M paid erroneously** (30.4% of total payments)
- **SAR 19.69M denied without reason codes** (compliance risk)
* Top denial reasons:
  * Pre-existing conditions: 41.8%
  * Non-covered services: 29.6%
  * Insufficient documentation: 18.9%
* Submission delays range 0‚Äì29 days, disrupting financial forecasting

---

### **Category 4: Insurance Plan & Regional Performance**
#### Key Insights:
* **Bupa Premium** had the **highest wait times (68.7 mins)** despite being top-tier
* **Dammam** showed the **worst surgical wait times (67.8 mins)**
* **Khobar** had high overall waits despite mid-volume patient load
* **SA Cares** consistently delivered highest coverage efficiency

---

## **Data Collection and Sources**
Data was extracted from the SNHI relational claims and appointment databases. No APIs were used. Manual CSV ingestion was performed for supplementary patient info (insurance tier, city, specialty) and claim denial mappings.

---

## **Formal Data Governance**
* Column standardization for provider IDs, date formatting (ISO 8601), and appointment outcomes
* Null value handling: rescheduling dates and wait times cleaned and verified against actual timestamps
* Proposed governance: implement denial reason validation logic + timestamp auto-auditing

---

## **Regulatory Reporting**
Compliance issues were flagged, especially in overpaid claims with no denial code (SAR 55.9M). System redesign is recommended to enforce documentation compliance and reduce legal exposure. A regulator-aligned denial taxonomy should be implemented.

---

## **Methodology**
* Python used for data cleaning, joining, transformation
* Statistical analysis (mean, variance decomposition) for wait time and claims
* power bi dashboards built for city/provider/insurance segmentation
* Conditional logic for risk flagging (e.g., cancellation % > 50, wait time > 90 mins)

## **Executive Summary**
**(Stakeholder: Claims & Operations Director)**  
Appointment bottlenecks and claim overpayments are costing SNHI millions. The biggest risks come from:
- Surgeries with excessive wait times  
- Providers handling mismatched cases  
- Poorly governed claim denial systems  

> **Three Critical Takeaways:**  
> 1. Reducing wait time by **1 minute** may eliminate **250 no-shows**  
> 2. Over **SAR 75M in claim payments were erroneous/unjustified**  
> 3. Top-tier insurance patients receive **worse service** than economy-tier

## **Insights Deep Dive**

### **Category 1: Appointment Outcomes & Wait Times**
* **10% of appointments (5,034) resulted in no-shows** with avg wait of 67.99 mins  
* **Follow-up appointments**: Highest no-show wait time (68.83 mins)  
* Emergency care had shortest wait (66.97 mins), validating triage effectiveness  

### **Category 2: Provider Efficiency & Operational Risk**
* 65.5% of providers had only **1 completed appointment**  
* **PRV007848**: 75% cancellation rate due to specialty violations  
* Over 1,100 providers had **120-min avg waits**, driving system-wide attrition  

### **Category 3: Claims Denials & Financial Exposure**
* SAR 75.3M paid erroneously; 98.5% coverage rate shows **excessive leniency**  
* 41.8% denials due to **pre-existing conditions** = weak eligibility checks  
* Claims without denial reasons received **SAR 55.9M in payments**  

### **Category 4: Insurance Plan & Regional Performance**
* **Dammam**: Worst surgical wait (67.8 mins) vs **Taif** best (66.4 mins)  
* **Bupa Premium**: Higher wait times than lower-tier plans  
* **Khobar**: Worst regional performance despite mid-level patient volume

## **Recommendations**
**For Claims, Operations, and Network Management Teams:**  

**I. Appointment Efficiency & Patient Experience**  
*(Target: Operations & Patient Services)*
1. **Implement dynamic scheduling buffers**  
   - Add 15-min buffer slots for follow-ups/consultations (avg 68.83 min wait)  
   - Replicate emergency department triage model for all high-wait services  
   - Automate SMS reminders + rescheduling offers for appointments >67 min wait  

2. **Optimize regional capacity**  
   - Deploy Taif‚Äôs surgical scheduling model to Dammam (67.8 min wait)  
   - Redistribute Khobar‚Äôs mid-volume load to underutilized facilities  
   - Create Bupa Premium fast-track lanes (guarantee ‚â§60-min wait via contract clauses)  

**II. Provider Network Management**  
*(Target: Network Development & Compliance)*  
3. **Enforce provider performance standards**  
   - Suspend providers with >50% cancellation rate (e.g., PRV007848) for specialty retraining  
   - Consolidate 15,000+ single-appointment providers into continuity-of-care teams  
   - Apply 5% reimbursement penalties for consistent >90-min wait times  

4. **Align specialties with facilities**  
   - Block surgical bookings at imaging centers (violation hotspot)  
   - Reassign 15-min-wait providers to consultation-heavy departments  
   - Launch monthly provider-city matching audits  

**III. Claims Integrity & Financial Controls**  
*(Target: Finance & Claims Administration)*  
5. **Recover overpayments & tighten approvals**  
   - Launch 90-day SAR 75.3M overpayment recovery initiative  
   - Mandate denial reason codes before any payment (prevent SAR 55.9M unsubstantiated payments)  
   - Enforce 5% reimbursement cuts for claims submitted >7 days post-visit  

6. **Prevent future leakage**  
   - Implement automated pre-authorization checks for pre-existing conditions (41.8% denials)  
   - Install real-time claim validation against coverage policies (block 29.6% non-service denials)  
   - Integrate document-integrity AI to reduce 18.9% documentation denials  

**IV. Patient Retention & Growth**  
*(Target: Marketing & Member Services)*  
7. **Reactivate high-value relationships**  
   - Offer $25 credit for 7,507 inactive patients  
   - Adopt SA Cares‚Äô coverage efficiency model across all plans  
   - Launch no-show prediction models (using wait time + insurance history)  

---

## **Future Work**
* Incorporate patient feedback surveys for non-wait-related cancellations  
* Develop no-show prediction models using wait time + insurance + provider history  
* Launch monthly claim denial audit dashboards with NLP on clinical notes  

---

## **Technical Details**
**Tools Used:**  
* **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy)**: Statistical analysis  
* **Power bi**: Dynamic dashboards and visualizations  

---

## **Assumptions and Caveats**
* **Assumption 1**: No-shows without completion timestamp considered canceled if rescheduled within 3 days  
* **Assumption 2**: Missing wait times imputed using type-specific averages  
* **Assumption 3**: `amount_paid > amount_claimed` treated as overpayments unless tagged "bonus/adjustment"
